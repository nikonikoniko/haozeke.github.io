Background Much the same as the rationale behind my meta-post on my talk at PyCon India 2020, that is:
I would like to preserve questions I would like to collect the video, slides and other miscellaneous stuff in one location 1 It would be nice to have my own thoughts here afterwards Details Title Nix from the dark ages (without Root) Proposal See the cfp response here Abstract Short comments from the trenches of High Performance Clusters on working with Nix on kernel locked-in systems without proot support.</description></item><item><title>Talk Supplements for PyCon India 2020</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pycon-in-2020-meta/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 23:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/pycon-in-2020-meta/</guid><description>A meta-post on my talk at PyCon India 2020
Background I am to present at PyCon IN 2020. Some of the motivating reasons for having a post are:
I would like to preserve questions I would like to collect the video, slides and other miscellaneous stuff in one location 1 It would be nice to have my own thoughts here afterwards Details of this happy circumstance are reproduced below from the CFP here.</description></item><item><title>Grant Proposals - I</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/grant-proposals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 20:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/grant-proposals/</guid><description>Personal recollections of the academic grant writing process.
Background Of the many types of writing one undertakes in a typical academic career, grant writing stands out as a rather large anomaly. For the purposes of this post, we will note that an academic writing taxonomy would consist of roughly:
Coursework and Assignmets These are more or less comparitive writing exercises, where the only main thing which is enforced is (or should be) plagiarism checks.</description></item><item><title>LineageOS Maintainer Appreciation</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/linos-maintainer-appre/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/linos-maintainer-appre/</guid><description>A post on a surprisingly heartwarming community appreciation effort.
Background As probably anyone who has asked me about my programming experience has heard, my first real foray into the FOSS community was being a LineageOS co-maintainer (as HaoZeke) for the Xperia Z5 Dual. I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about the community all that much for a few years, mostly since XDA became pretty toxic, and Android development just got, less exciting.</description></item><item><title>Site Rationale</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rationale/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rationale/</guid><description>Why this site exists I have a lot of online presences. I have been around (or at-least, lurking) for over ten years. Almost as long as I have been programming. Anyway, I have a penchant lately for using emacs and honestly there isn&amp;rsquo;t very good support for org-mode files. There are options recently with gatsby as well, but this seemed kinda neat.
What &amp;lsquo;this&amp;rsquo; is This site is built by Hugo The posts are generated with ox-hugo The theme is based of this excellent one by Djordje Atlialp, which in turn is based off of this theme by panr My modifications are here What is here Mostly random thoughts I don&amp;rsquo;t mind people knowing Some tech stuff which isn&amp;rsquo;t coherent enough to be put in any form with references Emacs specific workflows which I might want to write about more than short notes on the config What isn&amp;rsquo;t here Some collections should and will go to my grimoire My doom-emacs configuration Academic stuff is better tracked on Publons or Google Scholar or my pages hosted by my favorite IITK group or UI group</description></item><item><title>Collection of WebLinks</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rg-collection-weblinks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 1995 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rg-collection-weblinks/</guid><description>An attempt to re-claim and verify my digital presence.
Background I mentioned on my about page, that it is nigh impossible to keep track of every digital trace there is of me. That said, it is really not even a countable infinite set yet, so it is a good idea to get started before it gets much worse. This is minimally curated, and will only be sporadically updated, so take everything here with a grain of salt.</description></item></channel></rss>
