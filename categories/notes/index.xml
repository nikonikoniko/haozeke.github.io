Background Since the advent of the COVID-19 situation, there has been an increase in the demand for recorded materials. Standard approaches involve Zoom, which is not only proprietary, but also quite a bit of a privacy nightmare. The last straw was the random placement of my speaker bauble head.

At this point, given that I was to set up a pre-recorded video for PyCon India 2020, I decided to look into alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Explorations with Backlight Controllers</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/expl-backlight-control/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2020 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/expl-backlight-control/</guid><description>A short post detailing the many trials and tribulations of setting brightness on multiple monitors in tandem.
Background As regular readers might know, I have a multi-screen setup, which accounts for having touch enabled on my primary laptop screen (detailed here). A failing of this setup was that I was not able to control the brightness of both monitors at the same time.
Existing Stack Since I use i3, my brightness control is simply done with bindsym lines as follows1:</description></item><item><title>Multiple Monitors with Touchscreens</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/multi-monitor-touch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 22:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/multi-monitor-touch/</guid><description>A short tutorial post on multiple screens for laptops with touch-support and ArchLinux. Also evolved into a long rant, with an Easter egg.
Background Of late, I have been attempting to move away from paper, for environmental reasons1. Years of touch typing in Colemak (rationale, config changes) and a very customized Emacs setup (including mathematica, temporary latex templates, Nix, and org-roam annotations) have more or less kept me away from analog devices.</description></item><item><title>Analytics II: Goat to Clicky</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-clicky/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 23:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-clicky/</guid><description>A follow up to my earlier post on analytics, and on migrating from Goat Counter to Clicky.
Background A few days ago I recieved the following email:
Hi there!
I made some changes to the GoatCounter plans/pricing:
GoatCounter now has a &amp;ldquo;Starter&amp;rdquo; plan, this is â‚¬5/month, limited to 100k pageviews/month, comes with a custom domain, and allow commercial use. This is mostly the same as the &amp;ldquo;personal plus&amp;rdquo; plan there was before, except that it allows commercial use.</description></item><item><title>LosslessCut, Zoom and an AMA for CS106A</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/losslesscut-zoom-ama/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 20:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/losslesscut-zoom-ama/</guid><description>Background I recently had the opportunity to take part in an AMA (ask me anything) session for the CS106A students on Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences. This is a post about the technical issues, and also includes a video if you read through.
Zoom and LosslessCut Zoom recordings are one of the nicer ways to deal with switching windows and screen sharing, especially after fixing the dark screen glitch. However, though LosslessCut works really well to get cut-points, exporting and merging the file into one caused a bunch of glitches.</description></item><item><title>Compton to Picom and Zoom Glitches</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/compton-zoom-shadow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 01:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/compton-zoom-shadow/</guid><description>Background I have been leading the fantastic section 881 as a virtual section leader for the Stanford CS106A: Code in Place initiative for the past four weeks. I have also spent a lot of time on Zoom, sharing my screen. Fun fact. My screen shares look like this:
Figure 1: Zoom screen share with weird overlay
This post is about hunting down what caused this amazing zoom glitch1 and how I finally fixed it.</description></item><item><title>CS106A Small Group Training</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-smallgrp-trainig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 07:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-smallgrp-trainig/</guid><description>Background As I mentioned earlier, I&amp;rsquo;m leading a section for Stanford CS106A: Code in Place. This post relates to the notes and thoughts garnered during the small group training session1.
Reflections Demographics Redacted. Did not use breakout meetings due to privacy issues.
Engagement and Participation Some people were more active (skewed responses) Some of the more rudimentary questions might have been suppressed Highlighted Moments Covering multiple perspectives Different mental models Challenges and Transformations Technical debt was an issue Lack of engagement Went on for too long For me in particular:</description></item><item><title>CS106A Section Meeting I</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-smallgrp-meet1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 22:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-smallgrp-meet1/</guid><description>Background As I mentioned earlier, I&amp;rsquo;m leading a section for Stanford CS106A: Code in Place. I did also mention I&amp;rsquo;d try to keep a set of short notes on the process. I finally had my first section meeting!
Preparation I went through the following:
Sent out a welcome message Detailed the workflow Set up a HackMD instance Set up some slides in beamer1 However, after that, I was still concerned since I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much of a response on the ice-breakers for EdStem.</description></item><item><title>Small Section On-boarding</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-smallgrp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 02:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-smallgrp/</guid><description>Background As I mentioned in my last post, I&amp;rsquo;m leading a section for Stanford CS106A: Code in Place. I did also mention I&amp;rsquo;d try to keep a set of short notes on the process. So there1.
The Training Given the overwhelming number of students, and section leaders, the small groups are for fostering a community of teachers.
Consider allowing for daisy chaining during introductions Discussions are the primary take-away Only the instructor should be coding during the session Core components Clarity Content Atmosphere Section management Correctness Sectional Details Check in at the start Notice the space Check in regularly Avoid negative phrases Establish norms and the general culture Zoom Norms Have people introduce themselves Mute people when they aren&amp;rsquo;t talking Raise hands Try to use icebreakers which respect privacy Materials Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the stuff which, being as it was open-sourced, I suppose is OK to put here2.</description></item><item><title>On-boarding for Code in Place</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-onboarding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-onboarding/</guid><description>Background A few weeks ago, I ended up recording a video for the Stanford CS106A: Code in Place initiative (which can be found here). I heard back a while ago, and am now to lead a section for the course!
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be making a series of short posts as this process continues.
On-Boarding This was very reminiscent of the Carpentries instructor training, which makes sense, given how well thought out that experience was.</description></item><item><title>Analytics: Google to Goat</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 17:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</guid><description>Background Like a lot of my tech based rants, this was brought on by a recent Hacker News post. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why the product listed there is a hollow faux FOSS rip-off. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss how the &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; analytics option, like many others are just hobby projects taking pot shots at other projects. Or how insanely overpriced most alternatives are.
I will however discuss why and how I transitioned to using the awesome Goat Counter.</description></item><item><title>Trees and Bags</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/trees-and-bags/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/trees-and-bags/</guid><description>Explain why using bagging for prediction trees generally improves predictions over regular prediction trees.
Introduction Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregation) is one of the most commonly used ensemble method for improving the prediction of trees. We will broadly follow a historical development trend to understand the process. That is, we will begin by considering the Bootstrap method. This in turn requires knowledge of the Jacknife method, which is understandable from a simple bias variance perspective.</description></item><item><title>D3 for Git</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</guid><description>Background I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind The site Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description></item><item><title>Shorter Posts</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</guid><description>Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas Conclusions I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox</description></item><item><title>Taming Github Notifications</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/ghnotif/</guid><description>Background As a member of several large organizations, I get a lot of github notifications. Not all of these are of relevance to me. This is especially true of psuedo-monorepo style repositories like the JOSS review system and especially the exercism community.
I recently (re-)joined the exercism community as a maintainer for the C++ lessons after having been a (sporadic) teacher This was largely in response to a community call to action as the group needed new blood to usher in v3 of the exercism project Anyway, I have since found that at the small cost of possibly much of my public repo data, I can manage my notifications better with Octobox</description></item></channel></rss>
