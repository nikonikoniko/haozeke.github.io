Background Ever since Travis CI decided to drink corporate kool-aid, the search for a new CI has been brought to the fore again. Github Actions seem uniquely suited for private repositories, since most CIs bill for private repos. However, the basic authentication setup for the checkout action involves using one SSH key, effectively a personal access token, for both the main project and all submodules.</description></item><item><title>Remapping Keys with XKB and KLFC</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/remap-keys-xkb-klfc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 22:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/remap-keys-xkb-klfc/</guid><description>An introduction to hacking keyboard layouts with X keyboard extension (XKB) and klfc, focused on Colemak and vim bindings

Background A recent Hacker News post reminded me of Anki, and that brought back memories of my Anki orgmode setup. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d re-create and immortalize it.
The standard way of working with Anki, is with a pretty awkward GUI. There are changes to be made here, which make life a little easier, including the setup of custom cards, but the inherent concerns of the WYSIWYG editor are basically insurmountable.</description></item><item><title>Old Laptops as Secondary Monitors</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/laptop-as-second-screens/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 23:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/laptop-as-second-screens/</guid><description>Dual screen workflows without screens across operating systems

Background Since the advent of the COVID-19 situation, there has been an increase in the demand for recorded materials. Standard approaches involve Zoom, which is not only proprietary, but also quite a bit of a privacy nightmare. The last straw was the random placement of my speaker bauble head.

Background My project proposal for documenting Symengine was recently accepted for the Google Summer of Docs initiative.

Though this is still a feasible method, a monolithic multi-project setup might benefit from Sphinx, which is what will be covered.</description></item><item><title>Local Nix without Root</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/local-nix-no-root/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/local-nix-no-root/</guid><description>Monkeying around with nix for HPC systems which have no root access and NFS filesystems.
Background Nix is not well known for being friendly to users without root access. This is typically made worse by the &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; filesystem attributes common to HPC networks (this also plagues hermes). An earlier post details how and why proot failed. The short pitch is simply:

Background In previous posts, there was a discussion on a ground up approach to adding packages which aren&amp;rsquo;t on the core nixpkgs channels using GitHub or PyPi sources. However, this lacked a way to do so programmatically, and also a way to convert existing python projects.

Background Of the many types of writing one undertakes in a typical academic career, grant writing stands out as a rather large anomaly. For the purposes of this post, we will note that an academic writing taxonomy would consist of roughly:

Consider allowing for daisy chaining during introductions Discussions are the primary take-away Only the instructor should be coding during the session Core components Clarity Content Atmosphere Section management Correctness Sectional Details Check in at the start Notice the space Check in regularly Avoid negative phrases Establish norms and the general culture Zoom Norms Have people introduce themselves Mute people when they aren&amp;rsquo;t talking Raise hands Try to use icebreakers which respect privacy Materials Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the stuff which, being as it was open-sourced, I suppose is OK to put here2.</description></item><item><title>On-boarding for Code in Place</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-onboarding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/scp-onboarding/</guid><description>Background A few weeks ago, I ended up recording a video for the Stanford CS106A: Code in Place initiative (which can be found here).

On-Boarding This was very reminiscent of the Carpentries instructor training, which makes sense, given how well thought out that experience was.</description></item><item><title>Analytics: Google to Goat</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 17:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/goat-google/</guid><description>Background Like a lot of my tech based rants, this was brought on by a recent Hacker News post. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into why the product listed there is a hollow faux FOSS rip-off. I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss how the &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; analytics option, like many others are just hobby projects taking pot shots at other projects. Or how insanely overpriced most alternatives are.

Introduction Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregation) is one of the most commonly used ensemble method for improving the prediction of trees. We will broadly follow a historical development trend to understand the process. That is, we will begin by considering the Bootstrap method. This in turn requires knowledge of the Jacknife method, which is understandable from a simple bias variance perspective.</description></item><item><title>D3 for Git</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/d3git/</guid><description>Background I have had a lot of discussions regarding the teaching of git This is mostly as a part of the SoftwareCarpentries, or in view of my involvement with univ.ai, or simply in every public space I am associated with Without getting into my views, I just wanted to keep this resource in mind The site Learning git is a highly contentious thing People seem to be fond of GUI tools, especially since on non *nix systems, it seems that there is a lot of debate surrounding obtaining the git utility in the first place One of the best ways of understanding (without installing stuff) the mental models required for working with git is this site</description></item><item><title>Shorter Posts</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/shortpost/</guid><description>Background Sometime this year, I realized that I no longer have access to a lot of my older communication. This included, a lot of resources I enjoyed and shared with the people who were around me at that point in time. To counter this, I have decided to opt for shorter posts, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t always include the same level of detail I would prefer to provide.
Alternatives I have an automated system based around IFTTT combined with Twitter, Diigo, and even Pocket However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really tell me much, and trawling through a massive glut of data is often pointless as well There&amp;rsquo;s always Twitter, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really care to hear the views of others when I want to revisit my own ideas Conclusions I will be making shorter posts here, like the random one on octobox</description></item><item><title>Provisioning Dotfiles on an HPC</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 00:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/prov-dots/</guid><description>Background My dotfiles turned 4 years old a few months ago (since 9th Jan 2017) and remains one of my most frequently updated projects for obvious reasons. Going through the changes reminds me of a whole of posts I never got around to writing.
Anyway, recently I gained access to another HPC cluster, with a standard configuration (bash, old CentOS) and decided to track my provisioning steps.

Followed by this post on refactoring my Dotfiles.
Background I just realized that it has been over two years since I switched from QWERTY to Colemak but somehow never managed to write about it. It was a major change in my life, and it took forever to get acclimatized to. I do not think I&amp;rsquo;ll ever again be in a position to make such a change in my life again, but it was definitely worth it.</description></item><item><title>Bojack Horseman</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/bojack-horseman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 22:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/bojack-horseman/</guid><description>Background For a while I was worried about writing about a TV show here. I thought it might be frivolous, or worse, might outweigh the other kinds of articles I would like to write. However, like most things, that which is ignored just grows, so it is easier to just write and forget about it.
The Show Much has been said about how Bojack Horseman is one of the best shows ever, and they&amp;rsquo;re all correct.</description></item><item><title>ISLR :: Moving Beyond Linearity</title><link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/islr-ch7/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 09:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rgoswami.me/posts/islr-ch7/</guid><description>Chapter VII - Moving Beyond Linearity All the questions are as per the ISL seventh printing.
